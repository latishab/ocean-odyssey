                Welcome to your ocean mission! Your goal is to study how life adapts 
                to changing conditions in the sunlit zone of Earth's oceans.
                
                First, let's understand how light behaves underwater. Try moving the red ball 
                deeper to see how water affects different colors - this will help us understand 
                why marine creatures look so different at various depths.

                As we descend through the sunlit zone, pressure becomes an increasingly 
                important factor. Every 10 meters of depth adds another atmosphere of pressure!
                
                Look closely at how pressure affects different objects - these observations 
                will help us understand how marine life adapts to increasing pressure.

                        - Start with 1 ATM (surface pressure)

                        Formula: Pressure = (depth รท 10) + 1 ATM
                        
                        Example: At 50m depth
                        - Depth รท 10 = 50 รท 10 = 5
                        - Add 1 ATM = 5 + 1 = 6 ATM total
